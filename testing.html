        <h1>Master Runescape's new stand-alone combat style</h1>
        <p>Necromancy is entirely independent from existing Combat Styles, sitting outside the existing combat triangle. This fully-fledged combat system includes its own dual-wield weapons, armour, abilities and incantations - while supporting skills and items that work with other combat styles today. Something we're particularly excited about is that you can take this skill anywhere across Gielinor - face off against bosses you haven't touched in years or level against some rats in Varrock Sewers. The world is your oyster.</p>

            <p style="font-size: medium; color: antiquewhite;">As a Necromancer, you'll mix two types of Necromantic power. Necrotic attacks - which are channelled with your Death Guard - focus on using Necromatic power to damage, debuff or afflict your foes with a variety of effects. Your other weapon, the Spirit Lantern, is used to fulfil that Necromancy fantasy we all have of conjuring the dead! <strong>As a Necromancer, you'll conjure your undead allies to fight in battle alongside you</strong> and enhance their capabilities with various abilities earned as you level.</p>
